# Development Status

Repository baseline: routed frontend pages exist for all nine modules. No backend source or verified end-to-end persistence is present. API attempts with mock fallback are not marked Integrated.

## Module status

- Dashboard: frontend/mock role-specific widgets and navigation; static metrics, not synchronized with orders/inventory. Backend pending.
- Sales Orders: frontend/mock fast-entry multi-line form, validation, filters, sorting, pagination and CSV export; shared navigation-safe Context. Backend pending.
- Job Cards: data-derived summaries, combined search/status/department/stage/date filters, detail tabs, approval/edit, full/partial material issue, dynamic production tracking and handovers, stage waste, activity history, delay warnings and frontend Stock Keeping confirmation. Existing stage toggles/API fallback retained; shared navigation-safe JobCardsContext. Linked-order receipts now post into shared frontend inventory; backend persistence remains pending; custom requirements now derive from explicit model/estimate recipes.
- Stock: frontend/reference variant inventory, Brand → Pieces → Packaging columns, optional pieces-per-package metadata, detailed Stock IN/OUT, history, monthly reporting/export and open-order demand comparison. Backend pending.
- Raw Material: frontend/reference category/family views, combinable family/unit/status filters and search with reset, Stock in Hand labels, detailed Stock IN/OUT, balances, movement history and monthly CSV reports. Backend pending.
- Consumables: frontend Add/Edit/View, Imported Spare/Local Spare categories, Each/Both/Litres/Kilos units, search/filter/reset, Stock IN/OUT and movement history. Starts empty; navigation-safe state resets on refresh. No Spare Parts module exists in this checkout. Backend pending.
- Recycling: waste/granule read views and summaries; API/mock fallback. No intake/production posting workflow. Backend pending.
- Costing: cost/rate read views and rate entry; API/mock/local fallback. No cost recalculation. Backend pending.
- Track & Trace: search and history display; API lookup with seeded examples on failure. Backend pending.
- Masters: shared session-only revisioned model drafts used by orders/costing/jobs; other item/customer/supplier/department/user edits remain page-local. Backend persistence pending.

## Sales fulfillment update

Sales Order detail, per-line manual fulfillment, linked custom jobs, QC-confirmed partial receipt batches, reservations, partial dispatch/reversals and invoice snapshots now share session state. Stock includes reserved/available balances and date-range history. See [implementation, checks and limitations](sales-fulfillment.md). Browser verification is blocked by browser access to localhost.

## Recently Completed

Available in the inspected baseline (not a claim about implementation dates): multi-line sales entry, separate finished-goods/raw-material ledgers, workbook-derived reference loading and finished-goods demand comparison.
Documentation baseline now records actual architecture, models and integration gaps.

## Currently In Progress

Overall phase: frontend workflow validation. No separate active implementation task is inferred from this snapshot.

## Next Priorities

- Confirm authoritative inventory reservation/issue/production/dispatch rules and source-data ambiguities.
- Plan durable orders, masters and inventory integration at the existing state boundaries.
- Replace silent mock/local write fallback with explicit success/failure behavior during integration.
- Connect dashboard/recycling/master data flows and verify server permissions.

## Review limitations

Local orders and inventory reset on refresh; non-model page-local master edits reset on remount; shared model revisions reset on refresh. Job-card stage and costing-rate writes may appear updated after an API failure.
Authentication is not restored from stored tokens. Role-filtered navigation is not server access control.
Recycling and costing summary month labels do not filter loaded rows by month; Dashboard uses separate demo currency/metrics.

## Verification

Documentation-only changes do not change application behavior. Use README commands for typecheck, build and the finished-goods data check; no lint setup exists.

Baseline checks passed: TypeScript without emit, Vite production build to a temporary directory, finished-goods checks, Markdown links and Git whitespace checks. Standard npm run build could not write the existing tsconfig.tsbuildinfo (EPERM); the separate checks avoid that file. Vite reported a bundle-size warning.

Inventory update verification: TypeScript passed using a temporary incremental cache; Vite production build and both inventory data-check scripts passed. Browser checks covered Consumables Add/Edit/View, categories/units, filters/reset, movement history and navigation-safe state; Raw Material combined search/filters and IN/OUT; Finished Goods pieces prefilling and IN/OUT. No browser console errors were captured in these workflows. Desktop/tablet layouts and mobile modal containment were inspected. The existing fixed-width sidebar remains limiting on narrow screens. Standard npm run build still hits the pre-existing tsconfig.tsbuildinfo EPERM; Vite still reports the existing bundle-size warning.

Job Cards upgrade verification: TypeScript with a temporary incremental cache, Vite production build, manufacturing invariant checks and both inventory checks passed. Browser checks covered combined filters, required stages, editing/approval, partial/full issue, stage completion, same-unit handover, mixed-unit safeguards, waste/history, stock confirmation and completed-card locks. No console errors were captured during those workflows. Tablet forms were inspected; the existing fixed sidebar limits narrow screens. Standard npm run build retains the existing tsconfig.tsbuildinfo EPERM; Vite retains its bundle-size warning.
Final clean reload rendered Job Cards correctly. Development hot updates briefly produced a provider-context mismatch; reloading cleared it. Backend integration still needs durable workflow storage and atomic inventory posting.

## Custom costing and routing — 2026-10-09

Implemented and connected frontend custom lines, versioned models, recipe/process costing, USD/UGX snapshots, markup scenarios, estimate revision/approval/printing/customer response, linked draft Job Cards, dynamic PM routing and approved-stage tracking. Store issue remains local tracking; unmapped QC output retains prepared receipts. Actual Cost/Variance are unavailable. TypeScript, build and all five workflow checks passed; browser UI/printing validation remains unavailable and Vite reports a large-bundle warning. No backend/dependencies/contracts changed. See [changed files, formulas, assumptions and remaining integration](custom-costing-routing.md).
