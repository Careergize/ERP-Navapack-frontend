# Sales fulfillment frontend implementation

This work adds a session-only transaction chain to the existing React stores. No backend files, schema, endpoint contracts or dependencies changed. All state resets on refresh.

## Implemented behavior

- Sales Orders retain multi-line entry and require a manual fulfillment source per line, transaction currency and tax rate (including explicit zero). Demand creation does not move stock. Tax uses a single transaction rate; line-specific or jurisdiction rule engines are not implemented.
- `/sales-orders/:id` tracks each unit separately, linked jobs, receipts, outstanding allocations, confirmed dispatches and remaining demand. The list derives fulfillment status from the same records.
- Custom lines create one linked Job Card using selected existing model stages and stable order/line/product/model IDs. Model BOMs contain descriptions without quantities, so materials are an explicitly editable draft entered before creation and reviewed by PM. Existing approval, Store issue, stage tracking, activity and unit handover validation remain.
- Linked quantity/product/model/unit are protected during Job Card edits. Legacy demo jobs lacking stable product/line links cannot post stock through name matching.
- After all required production stages complete, Store confirms QC, accepted quantity, rejected quantity, lot and date. Positive accepted quantity posts an idempotent IN (a fully rejected remainder records QC history without a zero stock movement) to InventoryContext. Multiple partial receipt batches are supported; the job stays Ready for Stock until all final output is accounted for as accepted or rejected. Partial completion of individual production stages remains future work. Each receipt has a stable request ID and source references; no automatic allocation or dispatch occurs.
- Reservations are batch-aware and do not change physical quantities. Allocation requests are idempotent and cannot exceed unreserved known stock or remaining line demand.
- Confirmed partial dispatch posts OUT once, reduces physical and reserved quantities, and derives remaining demand. Recorded-date stock and batch availability are checked. The dispatcher records date, challan, destination, vehicle, remarks, unit, product, batch and stable order/line references.
- Dispatch cancellation appends an IN reversal, restores the reservation, and retains original OUT/history. Invoiced dispatch cancellation is disabled in the UI pending a credit-note/void workflow. There is no order-cancellation or reservation-release workflow yet.
- Manual Finished Goods OUT cannot consume reservations, exceed known stock or consume a production batch as unnamed reference stock. Raw Material and Consumables behavior is unchanged.
- Stock shows physical/reserved/available balances, transaction links/batches, month/year input and optional custom date range. Model filtering includes products with a linked production receipt; unlinked reference stock remains visible under All models. IN/OUT filters narrow movement details, never remove one direction from balance calculations. Unknown historical openings stay unknown.
- Invoice creation uses confirmed uninvoiced dispatches, quantity × order rate, a pre-tax monetary discount and configurable tax. Currency must match the order; conversion is unavailable. Buyer/seller addresses and tax/contact information are manually supplied. No sample supplier/customer is written into masters. Fiscal references are opt-in, supplied manually and unverified; no certified QR or official code is generated. Invoice creation never moves stock.

## Frontend interfaces

`SalesOrderItem.fulfillmentSource`, `SalesOrder.taxRate/currency` and additional display statuses; `JobCard.salesOrderItemId/finishedProductId/modelId/rejectedQuantity/stockTransfers`; movement source IDs, model and batch metadata; `Allocation`, `Dispatch`, `FulfillmentLedger`, `Invoice`, `InvoiceDraft`, and `StockReceiptOptions`.

InventoryContext owns reservations, dispatches, receipts and finished movements through a synchronous current-state ref. JobCardsContext validates completion before posting its receipt; order links use SalesOrdersContext; InvoicesContext retains invoice snapshots. Pure helpers implement transaction guards and calculations.

## Validation

Passed: TypeScript, production build, all four check scripts and diff whitespace check.

Commands: `node ./node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`, `node scripts/check-sales-fulfillment.mjs`, `node scripts/check-job-cards.mjs`, `node scripts/check-finished-goods.mjs`, `node scripts/check-inventory-workflows.mjs`, `git diff --check`.

The new suite verifies stock-only order creation, explicit source/currency/tax validation, linked model-based job creation, material draft guards, reservation idempotency and no physical deduction, partial dispatch/remaining quantities, repeated OUT prevention, batch/date bounds, reversals, unknown openings, month/range carry-forward, tax/discount/words and no invoice stock mutation, QC/approval guards and repeated/partial receipt batches. Existing suites cover PM approval, material issue, production ordering/handovers and reference-data/raw-material/consumable regressions.

Browser-driven UI verification was attempted but blocked: the in-app browser timed out reaching localhost, and the Chrome browser provider was unavailable. Do not treat build/helper checks as an end-to-end browser test. Vite reports a large bundle warning; no build error.

## Backend integration and unresolved decisions

Replace session stores with authoritative persistent operations, atomic ledger writes, reservation locking, server-side roles, idempotency keys and numbering. Reconcile order/job updates atomically with receipt/dispatch operations and invalidate/reload client state after successful writes. Existing Job Card GET/stage PATCH contracts were retained; new writes have no invented API endpoints. Server-loaded job data and in-memory reference inventory are not a production integration.

Resolve company settings, authoritative customer/model masters, BOM quantities and yields, QC authority, warehouse locations, tax/jurisdiction rules and rounding, credit notes/invoice voids, order cancellations/reservation releases, approval revisions, split Job Cards and partial stage completions. Invoice discounts apply before tax as an explicit frontend convention requiring confirmation. Existing stock uses the labelled `reference-stock` bucket because original batch identities are unavailable; they are not fabricated lots. Unknown openings block allocation even after receipts until authoritative inventory is reconciled. Accepted stock confirmation currently uses Store Keeper/Admin roles, preserving the existing workflow.

The ERP.xlsx workbook and invoice image mentioned in the task were not supplied in the accessible task attachment or repository; the pasted fields and existing workbook-derived inventory references were used. Masters remain page-local and Dashboard/Track & Trace retain their existing mock/API behavior. Raw issue remains production tracking without raw inventory deduction. These limitations are visible/documented rather than presented as persistence or complete backend integration.
