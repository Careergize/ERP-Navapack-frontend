# Architecture

## Actual frontend structure

The application lives in navapack-frontend, which has its own Git repository and package.json. No backend code is present.

src/main.tsx mounts React StrictMode and BrowserRouter. src/App.tsx composes AuthProvider, SalesOrdersProvider, InventoryProvider, ConsumablesProvider and JobCardsProvider. RequireAuth checks the in-memory user; AppShell hosts nested routes and role-filtered navigation. Navigation visibility is not server authorization.

Routes: / (Dashboard), /sales-orders and /sales-orders/new, /job-cards and /job-cards/:id, /stock, /raw-materials, /recycling, /costing, /track-trace, /masters and /login. The new-order route opens the modal on the list page. Placeholder.tsx remains in source but is not wired to these module routes.

Shared UI lives in components/ui; branding/login elements in components/login; shell/navigation in components/layout. Tailwind configuration and src/index.css supply styling. Branding is public/assets/Nava-logo.png. Vite maps @ to src and uses relative asset base paths.

## State and data flow

Sales order form -> validation/build helpers in lib/salesOrders.ts -> SalesOrdersContext -> list and Stock SalesOrderDemand.
The form selects finished-goods variant IDs and reads InventoryContext balances. Creating an order does not write movements.
Demand reads each open line against current finished-goods stock independently; it is not an allocation engine.

Finished-goods reference -> lib/finishedGoodsData.ts -> InventoryContext movements -> Stock balances, movement history and monthly reports.
Raw-material reference plus legacy demo granules -> lib/rawMaterialData.ts -> separate InventoryContext movements -> Virgin Material, Recycled Granules and Ink views.

Both Context stores survive navigation and reset on refresh. Non-model Masters have page-local mock add/edit state; these edits do not update the separately imported customer/staff suggestions in sales orders. JobCardsContext lazily loads the existing list/detail APIs with mock fallback, normalizes legacy records and keeps manufacturing mutations in frontend state across routes. The existing stage-requirement PATCH remains available with explicit fallback; approval/issue/stage actions remain local, and linked stock confirmations now post to InventoryContext without new endpoints. Recycling, Costing and Track & Trace use Axios with mock fallbacks. Dashboard uses its own static demo metrics rather than live Context totals.

Types are in src/types/index.ts and domain data/helper files. Balance functions and variant matching live alongside inventory types. Generated reference files contain workbook-derived records; extraction scripts require Python/openpyxl. Detailed FG interpretation is maintained in finished-goods-reference.md.

## Authentication

AuthContext keeps the user in memory and stores real-login access/refresh tokens in localStorage; it does not restore a user session on refresh or refresh tokens automatically. Login supports mock credentials under the conditions documented in README.md. Axios attaches a stored access/legacy token. Its 401 handler removes the legacy token and redirects outside login; complete token cleanup is currently in logout.

## Future Backend Integration

Replace Context seed loading/create/add methods with API adapters while preserving variant IDs, units and unknown balances. Connect master state to order selection and production data to inventory.

Existing client calls in lib/api.ts and module pages expect authentication, job-card reads/stage writes, recycling reads, costing/rate reads and writes, and trace lookup. They are not documented as implemented server contracts. Verify response shapes and error handling against the eventual backend; failed stage/rate writes currently retain local changes.

Define authoritative inventory posting, reservations, statuses and permissions before integrating production or dispatch. See BACKEND_TODO.md.

## Sales fulfillment

`/sales-orders/:id` connects existing stores. InventoryContext owns finished receipts, reservations and dispatch/reversal transactions. JobCardsContext posts validated QC receipts; SalesOrdersContext owns stable order/job links; InvoicesContext owns snapshots without moving stock. Pure helpers live in fulfillment.ts, salesJob.ts and invoices.ts. See [workflow limitations](sales-fulfillment.md).

## Custom costing and routing

ModelsContext and CostingContext provide shared, session-only versioned model/estimate state upstream of JobCardsContext. Existing order/job/inventory stores remain connected. ModelManager replaces page-local model editing; other master categories retain their previous behavior. CustomCosting extends the existing Costing page while preserving legacy record/rate calls. Dynamic routing uses domain helpers and approved snapshots rather than a fixed component route. See [implementation and boundaries](custom-costing-routing.md).
