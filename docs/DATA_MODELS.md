# Frontend Data Models

These are current TypeScript/frontend or mock models, not database schemas. API consumer types are not proof of implemented backend contracts.

## Sales orders (src/types/index.ts; src/lib/salesOrders.ts)

SalesOrder: id, orderNumber, customerName, date, Open/Completed status and jobCardIds; optional customerId, marketingPersonName, B2B/B2C customerType, requisitionOrder, items and orderTotal support legacy seed records.
SalesOrderItem: id, optional itemId (finished-goods variant reference), itemName, quantity, unit, unitPrice and totalPrice.
SalesOrderDraft contains form customer/date/marketing/type/requisition fields and items; customerType temporarily permits an empty value.
New orders get a UUID-derived ID and locally generated SO number (maximum numeric suffix + 1).
totalPrice = round(quantity x unitPrice, 2); orderTotal = round(sum of rounded line totals, 2). orderSummary returns the pre-tax subtotal; buildSalesOrder applies transaction tax to the order total. Invoice discounts/tax are calculated independently on selected dispatches.

## Finished goods (src/lib/finishedGoodsData.ts)

FinishedGood identifies a variant with id, category (carrier-bags/flat-bags/packing), subgroup, customer, itemDetails, size, brand, packingSize and unit.
Optional pieces is a positive whole-number count per package; existing reference records leave it unrecorded. InventoryContext holds navigation-safe finishedPieces overrides by variant ID. Pieces never changes the ledger unit or quantity.
openingStock is number or null; openingDate anchors the reference ledger. sourceSheet, sourceRow, sourceCustomer, customerInherited, sourceUnit, sourceClosingStock and dataNotes preserve provenance and ambiguity.

FinishedGoodsMovement: id, productId -> FinishedGood.id, date, type (IN/OUT), quantity, unit; optional customer, reference and remarks.
InventoryContext validates product existence, matching unit and positive finite quantity on additions.

## Raw material (src/lib/rawMaterialData.ts)

RawMaterial: id, name, family, category (virgin/recycled/ink), unit, nullable openingStock and openingDate; optional minLevel, sourceRow and nullable sourceClosingStock.
RawMaterialMovement: id, date, materialId -> RawMaterial.id, materialName, category, movementType (IN/OUT), quantity, unit, reference and remarks.
InventoryContext validates material/category/unit and positive finite quantity; it takes materialName from the master.

Both balance helpers return openingStock, stockIn, stockOut and currentStock. For known openings, currentStock = openingStock + stockIn - stockOut (six-decimal rounding).
Monthly opening adds signed movements before month start; monthly totals use dates starting with the selected month.
Unknown reference opening or a month before openingDate returns null opening/current balances while retaining movement totals.

## Demand projection (src/pages/Stocks/SalesOrderDemand.tsx)

There is no named SalesOrderDemand interface. A derived row extends an open SalesOrderItem with product, available, required, status, orderNumber and customer.
Product links by variant ID, with unique legacy-name/unit fallback. available is null if unlinked, mismatched or unrecorded.
required = max(0, quantity - max(0, available)) when available is known. Rows independently compare physical stock; no reservation ledger exists.

## Production and trace (src/types/index.ts)

JobCard retains id, jobCardNumber, salesOrderId, modelName, qty, status, department and legacy stages. Optional salesOrderNumber, customerName, product, specifications, productionRequirements, unit, createdDate, requiredDate, approval, requiredMaterials, productionStages, activityHistory, acceptedQuantity and stockTransfer support manufacturing tracking. Missing API quantities remain unrecorded; order references are resolved from existing SalesOrdersContext when available.
JobCardStatus additionally supports StoreIssuePending, MaterialIssued, OnHold and ReadyForStock; legacy Issued is displayed as Material Issued. Delayed is derived from requiredDate and is not stored as a replacement status.
JobCardMaterial contains id, optional exact raw materialId, name, requiredQuantity, issuedQuantity and unit. Availability is read only for an exact material/unit match; issue actions do not modify inventory.
JobProductionStage contains id, free-form name/department, sequence, required, production/stock kind, optional legacyStage mapping, Pending/Received/InProgress/Completed/OnHold status, nullable input/output/waste quantities, independent input/output/waste units, startedAt/completedAt, operator, remarks, optional handover source/quantity/unit, wasteType, wasteReason and sentToRecycling. Waste rows, current location and final produced quantity are derived from these records, avoiding duplicate quantities and incompatible-unit totals.
JobCardActivity contains id, timestamp, action, user, department and description. Stock transfer retains accepted quantity/unit, batch date, confirmation user/time, and job/sales-order/customer/model/product references. Neither is a permanent audit or inventory transaction.
Legacy JobCardStageEntry remains stage, sequenceOrder, required and Pending/InProgress/Complete status. Stage still enumerates Extrusion/Printing/Packaging/Stock/Ready to Sale for existing modules; dynamic manufacturing stage names do not extend or hard-code this shared enum. Required flags and completed statuses stay synchronized for mapped legacy stages.
TraceResult: traceId, SalesOrder/JobCard/MaterialBatch/GranulesBatch type, currentStatus, optional currentStage and label/timestamp history. Lookup results are API/mock data, not computed from Context records.

## Recycling and costing (src/types/index.ts)

WasteEntry: id, jobCardNumber (text reference), stage, wasteQty, kg unit, wasteType, sentToRecycling and date.
GranulesBatch: id, batchNumber, date, inputWasteQty, granulesProducedKg and destination; optional reEnteredQty, soldQty, soldTo. These fields do not automatically change inventory.
Recycling summaries sum unsent wasteQty and all loaded granulesProducedKg; despite month labels, there is no month filter.

CostingRecord: id, itemOrModel, rawMaterialCost, productionCost, otherCost, USD/NGN/GHS/ZAR currency, exchangeRateUsed, totalCostLocal and lastUpdated. totalCostLocal is supplied data; CostingPage does not calculate it.
ExchangeRate: id, currency, rate, date, enteredBy. New local entries prepend to history; existing costs are unchanged.

## Masters and user (src/types/index.ts)

Item: id, name, unit, category. This generic demo master is separate from FinishedGood.
Model: id, name, billOfMaterials (text), stages.
Customer: id, name, contactPerson, phone.
Supplier: id, name, materialSupplied, phone.
Department: id, name, assignedProductionManager (text).
MasterUser: id, name, email, role, optional department.
User: id, name, role, optional department; held by AuthContext.
Role: receptionist, production_manager, store_keeper, production_operator, recycling_operator, accounts or admin.
Master page edits are page-local; name fields are not enforced foreign-key relationships.

## Consumables (src/lib/consumableData.ts; ConsumablesContext)

Consumable: id, name, imported/local category, Each/Both/Litres/Kilos unit, openingStock, openingDate and optional minLevel. ConsumableMovement: id, materialId, date, IN/OUT type, quantity, reference and remarks. ConsumablesContext owns empty initial masters and movements, validates additions and locks posted units/openings. State survives navigation and resets on refresh.

## Sales fulfillment extensions

See [sales-fulfillment.md](sales-fulfillment.md) for extended line/order/job/movement fields and Allocation, Dispatch, FulfillmentLedger, Invoice and receipt interfaces. Tax/currency are transaction fields; invoice snapshots are separate from physical stock events. InventoryContext owns all finished movements/reservations/dispatches. Multiple receipt batches retain stable source/request IDs.

## Custom costing and routing additions

Revisioned Model recipes/processes/routing and CostEstimate input/totals/approval/customer-response snapshots are session models. Order lines retain model/revision/specification/delivery/estimate references; Job Cards retain model/estimate/routing revisions, approved material/route snapshots and reapproval history. Production stages carry machine, expected quantities/units, planned waste and instructions. Unmapped QC output may retain stockReceiptPending until an exact finished variant is selected. See [field and formula details](custom-costing-routing.md).
